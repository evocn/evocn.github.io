        Hey, I'm Alex!
        Here's a little bit about me, if you don't know me.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm 24 years old and I live in Bellevue, Washington.
        </p>

        <p>
        I make games, music, and short films.
        I publish it all through this site.
        </p>

        <p>
        I believe in small, personal works of art.
        I believe in the joy of learning things from scratch.
        I believe in the use of the whole self.
        That's where most of my stuff comes from.
        </p>

        <p>
        I love rock climbing, pixel art, graphics programming, ice hockey, good code,
        Mk.gee, <em>The Witness</em>, the mysterious games in <em>UFO 50</em> by Eirik Suhrke, <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>,
        nondualism, <em>Pokemon</em> nuzlockes, spikeball, and the summertime.
        </p>
